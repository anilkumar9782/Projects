The purpose of this project is to compare classification models and survival analysis in predicting death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) for patients with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, tobacco use, and other serum markers in the blood.  It is assumed that the reader of this project has a working knowledge of machine learning and survival analysis.  The dataset was obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data.  Please feel free to <a href='mailto:anilkumar9782@gmail.com'> email me</a> if there are any questions!
