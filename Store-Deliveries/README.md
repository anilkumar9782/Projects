## Store Deliveries
At the beginning of the COVID lockdown, a local company that facilitates ordering and home delivery of specific products has become inundated with orders.  As a result of this increased demand, many orders were being voided by the company's three participating stores, and there was also an increased volume of deliveries taking longer than the promised 1 hour goal.  The company is trying to gain more insight into the factors that contribute to orders getting voided and taking longer to deliver.  The data is from a one week period at the start of the COVID lockdown. 

I completed this project as part of a school assignment.  Please reference the .rmd and .html files.
