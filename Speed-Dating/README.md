## Speed Dating

Following a speed dating event, the events team received complaints from customers that they had to spend too much time talking to people who were clearly never going to be a match for them. Overall the event was a success and they would like to run it again, but are interested in whether they could predict ahead of time who the most likely matches would be. If they could be over 70% confident that someone is a match, they would match them at the start of the event. They would like to know, based on this criteria, what proportion of attendees might be correctly pre-matched. 

I completed this project for my DataCamp professional certification. The case study involved cleaning, visually exploring, and comparing logistic regression, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting modeling techniques to predict matches. After submitting and passing the technical portion, I completed the certification process by passing a live, non-technical presentation of the case study findings, which also involved making business recommendations.
