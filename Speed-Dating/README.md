## Speed Dating
I completed this project for my DataCamp professional certification.  The case study involved cleaning, visually exploring, and comparing logistic regression, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting modeling techniques to predict matches for a speed dating service.  After submitting and passing the technical portion, I completed the certification process by passing a live, non-technical presentation of the case study findings, which also involved making business recommendations based on the findings.  

Please reference the jupyter notebook or .html file to see the technical report, and the .pptx file to view the non-technical presentation.
