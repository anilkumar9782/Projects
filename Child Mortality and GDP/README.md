## Child Mortality and GDP per capita

For this project, I cleaned and merged two datasets that I obtained from the gapminder website: https://www.gapminder.org/data/

**Goal**: Clean and merge the two datasets such that each observation (row) represents:

<li>Country</li>
<li>Year</li>
<li>GDP per capita of the country for the year</li>
<li>Child mortality rate of the country for the year</li>
<br>
The final cleaned dataset was written to a .csv file and <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anil.kumar8305/viz/GlobalChildMortalityandGDP2001-2018/Story1"> 
                                                            visualization</a> was completed in Tableau.  
The visualizations examined global trends in child mortality rates and GDP per capita from 2001-2018.
